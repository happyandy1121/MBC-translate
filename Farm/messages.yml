      - |-
        &3Growstations &rcan be crafted inside of a crafting table. Note: You can only place a limited number of &3Growstations&r. You can increase your limit by upgrading skills inside of a &2Skill Archive&r.

        Once you have some seeds, you can then
      - |-
        plant them inside of the &3Growstation&r by dragging them onto the &cIron Bars&r. Once placed inside, you will need to ensure conditions are optimal for the seed to grow.

        You will firstly need &9Water &rwhich you can add by &5Right-Clicking &ron
      - |-
        the &3Growstation &rwith a &9Water Bucket&r.

        All Plants require a specific &cTemperature&r and &2Environment &rto grow. For information regarding both of these, see the specific help pages.
      - |-
        Once conditions are met, the plant will start to grow.

        After it has grown, it will either be ready to collect, or it will create various items that will be placed inside of the &3Growstation Inventory&r.
      - |-
        The Plant will always show its growing status on the &cIron Bars&r. Anything blocking its growth will be shown in &cred text&r.

        Plants can develop or have traits which can help, or have adverse effects
      - on your plant and its surroundings. See the trait guide for more information
        on what traits are, what plant temperaments do, and how to get traits.
    TEMPERATURE:

        &lTemperature Guide&r

        Plants have various required temperatures in order to grow. To grow these plants, you must meet this requirement.

        Different Biomes have various temperatures.
      - These temperatures are based on Minecraft's inherited biome temperature. Cold
        biomes will be cold, and warm biomes will be warm. The next page has all of
        the temperatures that plants can have.
      - |-
        &lTemperatures:&r

        » #0015FFGlacial &0(-3)

    TRAITS:
      Information:
      - |2-
             &lTraits Guide&r

        Traits are special things that plants can have attached to them.

      - |-
        To view a full list of traits, go to &2/farm codex plants &rand look inside of the 'Traits' tab at the bottom.

        Traits can be affected by a Plant's Temperament. See the Temperament guide for more information.
      - Traits such as &2Attractor &rwill pickup items in a radius around you and
        put those items into a chest next to the &3Growstation&r. Traits can randomly
        mutate onto a plant once planted if your &2Farming Level &ris above &235&r.
      - |-
        It is entirely random which effect(s) you will get from this.

        Most traits will not be active until the plant is fully grown.
    TEMPERAMENT:
      Information:
      - |-
        &lTemperament Guide&r

        When it comes to growing plants, you may see Temperament as an option on the item.

        Temperament only affects Traits and how those traits will interact between players and other mobs.
      - |-
        If a plant has a 'Friendly' Temperament, it will not attack players, or passive mobs such as cows, sheep, or pigs.

        If a plant has an 'Aggressive' Temperament, it will attack anything, including players.
      - |-

      - |-
        Bushes are designed in a way that they cost a lot to purchase, and the items they produce sell for less.

      - |-
        You can increase the amount of Bushes that you can place by upgrading various skills inside of the Skill Archive.
